<p>My name is <strong>Ron Keinan</strong>. I'm a composer, arranger and producer, currently based in Hamburg, Germany. I was born in Haifa, Israel, to a family of immigrants from Brazil. I studied the classical Double Bass under Mr. Michael Klinghoffer and got my B.Mus in classical Composition under Prof. Mark Kopytman in the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. Later I moved to Germany and continued my studies in Jazz Composition under Prof. Wolf Kerschek in the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg.</p>  

<p id="composer"><strong>As a composer,</strong> I was educated in both the Classical and Jazz traditions. My compositions range from small chamber works to orchestral works, written for jazz musicians as well as  for classically trained musicians, for professionals and for amateurs. My music has been described as clear, communicative and direct.</p> 

<p id="arranger"><strong>I have arranged</strong> music in diverse genres, both for live and for the studio. I like writing to the strengths of the musicians and the particular requirements of the piece. Most of all, I enjoy working with Singers, Songwriters and Bands to create together the kind of sound they envision.</p>  

<p id="producer"><strong>Working as a producer</strong> and an engineer was a natural process for me, after arranging for the studio. Getting to know not only the instruments and musicians, but various microphones and their positioning, recording and mixing techniques, as well as MIDI programming is in my view an inseparable part of being a modern arranger. </p>
